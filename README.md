Project 1


We worked with the Product Reviews dataset, which contains approximately 25,000 customer reviews. The primary objective of this project is to predict a rating based on the textual content of a customer review.

To accomplish this, we first performed Sentiment Analysis using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). RNNs are a class of neural networks that are particularly effective for sequential data, as they are capable of retaining information from previous time steps to influence the current output.

To enhance performance and improve prediction accuracy, we further implemented Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTMs are an advanced variant of RNNs that address the vanishing gradient problem, allowing the model to capture long-term dependencies more effectively. This significantly contributed to more accurate and reliable sentiment classification.
